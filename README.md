(This product is available under a free and permissive license, but needs financial support to sustain its continued improvements. In addition to maintenance and stability there are many desirable features yet to be added.)

This image allows you to configure your printer to your Google Cloudprint easily thanks to Docker.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Google decided to discontinue Google Cloud Print Services as-of 2021 and suggest to migrate to self hosting with CUPS. This product will no longer be maintained.

Installation
---

```
docker run -d --privileged --restart=always -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v "$HOME/.cloudprint/":/root --name cloudprint -e CUPS_USER_ADMIN=admin -e CUPS_USER_PASSWORD=password -p 631:631 jaymoulin/google-cloudprint
```

You can change your admin login/password by replacing values for `CUPS_USER_ADMIN` and `CUPS_USER_PASSWORD`.

Change your `$HOME/.cloudprint/` volume to a path where you can keep your data. Then you'll be able to use the `configure load` and `configure save` to keep your configuration files 

Configuration
---
First, allow administration interface to be accessed to setup your printer:
```
docker exec cloudprint configure open
```
This will allow your printer to be configured. 
Go to http://__your_machine_ip__:631 to configure it

Login/Password couple defined with `$CUPS_USER_ADMIN` `$CUPS_USER_PASSWORD` in installation command

Once configured, close admin interface to secure it up and retrieve your Google Cloudprint URL.

```
docker exec -t cloudprint configure close
```

It will give you a Google Link. Copy/paste this URL in your browser to claim your printer, and voila!


Keeping data
------------

Use the following command to keep your CUPS configuration in your `save volume` (`$HOME/.cloudprint/` in the example)

```
docker exec -t cloudprint configure save
```

Use the following command to load your saved CUPS configuration from your `save volume` (`$HOME/.cloudprint/` in the example) back in CUPS 

```
docker exec -t cloudprint configure load
```


Updating
-----

When Google Cloudprint new version is released, you will be able to update your running version with this command:
 
```
docker exec -t cloudprint configure update
```
